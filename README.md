# Deep Learning Specialization

This repository contains my submissions for the *Deep Learning Specialization* offered by DeepLearning.ai.

As an undegraduate student at Colorado State University I specialized in Machine Learning and AI. As a graduate student I worked on a number of models using pytorch and tensor flow. 
This specialization gave me a chance to dive deeper into Neural Networks and Applications in Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing.

## Course 1: An introduction to Neaural Networks.

-  Bult a **Loistic Regression Classifier** "./NeuralNetworks/W2A2".
-  Bult a **Shallow Neural Network** for the classification of Planar Data "./NeuralNetworks/W3A1".
-  Bult a **Deep Neural Network** "./NeuralNetworks/W4A1"
- Compared **Deep Vs Shallow Neural Network's** performance on an image classification task "./NeuralNetworks/W4A2".

## Course 2: Improving Deep Learning Models - Hyperparameter Tuning and Optimization. 

-  Implemented **Parameter Initilization Tequniques** , Compared Zero Initialization, Random Initialization, and HE initialization and their effect on the optimization algorithm's ability to converge "./HyperParameterTuningAndRegularization/W1A1".
-  Implemented **L2 Regularization and Dropout** to provent overffiting "./HyperParameterTuningAndRegularization/W1A2".
-  Implemented **Gradient Checking** to verify my backpropagation implementations and debug Neural Neworks "./HyperParameterTuningAndRegularization/W1A3".
-  Implemented **Stochastic Gradient Descent, Mini-bacth Gradient Decent with Momentum and Learning Rate Decay, RMSProp, and Adam** "./HyperParameterTuningAndRegularization/W2A1".
-  Implemented **Neural Network with Tensor Flow** "./HyperParameterTuningAndRegularization/W3A1"

## Course 3: Structuring Machine Learning Projects
Course 3 had no programing assignments. The following topics where covered in lectures:
- Compared and contrasted **Satisfying vs Optimizing Metrics**
- Implications of **Same vs Different Probability Distributions** between Train/Dev/Test datasets
- **Bias vs Variance**
- **Transfer Learning and Multi-task Learning**


and applied to three case studies: A *flight simulator"*, a *"bird recognition problem"*, and an *"autonomous driving problem"*. There where <u> no programing assignments </u> only graded quizes for this course.

## Course 4: Convolutional Neural Networks
-  Implemented a **Convolutiona Neural Network** with numpy - including the padding, convolution, and pooling layers both *forward and backward* passes "./ConvolutionalNeuralNetworks/W1A1".
-  Implemented a **Convolutional Neural Network** for binary and multiclass image classification with Tensorflow's Sequential and Functional APIs "./ConvolutionalNeuralNetworks/W1A2".
-  Implemented a **Residual Network Architecture**  - including the identity and convolutional blocks with Tensorflow's Sequential API to address vanishing gradient problem "./ConvolutionalNeuralNetworks/W2A1".
-  Applied **Transfer Learning with MobileNet** to a binary classification task using Tensorflow's functional API to adapt the final layers and tune the model "./ConvolutionalNeuralNetworks/W2A2"
-  Built a **Car detection System** implemented YOLO object detection algorithm with non-max suppression and intersection over union. Fine tuned a pre-trained YOLO architecture for the car detection task "./ConvolutionalNeuralNetworks/W3A1".
-  Bult a **Face recognition and Detection Systems** by possing face recognition as a binary classification problem, implementing the triplet loss function, using a pre-traind model to encode face images into 128-dimensional encodings "./ConvolutionalNeuralNetworks/W4A1".
- Implemented **The Neural Style Transfer Algorithm** with numpy and tensor flow - including the style and content loss functions and gradient tape for the backpropagation "./ConvolutionalNeuralNetworks/W4A2".


## Course 5: Sequence Models




Note that some of the datasets and pre-trained models from Course 4 "Convolutional Neural Networks" where too large to store on a free GitHub account. Please email me at vasquezt2015@gmail.com for complete submissions with data sets.
